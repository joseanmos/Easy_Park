## Introduction

Parking in urban areas can be challenging. The **Easy Park** project aims to simplify this process. By using ultrasonic sensors to measure distance, it alerts users when they are too close to obstacles. The system uses visual and audio signals to provide immediate feedback, ensuring a safer parking experience.

For the latest releases, visit [this link](https://github.com/joseanmos/Easy_Park/releases). You can download the necessary files and execute them to set up your own parking assistant.

## Features

- **Real-time Distance Measurement**: Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance to obstacles.
- **Alert System**: Visual alerts through LEDs and audio alerts through a buzzer.
- **LCD Display**: Shows distance measurements and system status.
- **Password Protection**: Ensures that only authorized users can access certain features.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates traffic conditions to test the system under various scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple controls and displays for ease of use.

## Components

The following components are required to build the **Easy Park** system:

- **LPC1768 Microcontroller**: The brain of the project, handling all processing tasks.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures the distance to obstacles.
- **LEDs**: Provide visual alerts.
- **Buzzer**: Emits sound alerts.
- **LCD Display**: Shows relevant information.
- **Power Supply**: Provides necessary power to the components.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For prototyping and connections.
